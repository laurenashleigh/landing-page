        <h2>Animal Facts</h2>
        <p>The heart of a shrimp is located in its head. A snail can sleep for three years. The fingerprints of a koala are so indistinguishable from humans that they have on occasion been confused at a crime scene. Slugs have four noses. Elephants are the only animal that can't jump. A rhinoceros' horn is made of hair.</p>

        <p>One species of jellyfish is immortal. It can revert back to its child state after having become sexually mature, and therefore never dies.</p>

        <h2>Food Facts</h2>
        <p>Bet you didn’t know this. We sure didn’t! The Caesar salad started in a Mexican city called Tijuana. Restaurateur Chef Caesar Cardini was hosting a 4th of July celebration. He ran out of food, and simply threw the ingredients he had lying around the kitchen into a unique salad. Obviously, it was a huge success.
          Another weird and fun fact we bet you didn’t know, but the Caesar dressing is actually supposed to be a vinaigrette. It is made by combining minced garlic and anchovies into a bowl, which is than mixed with raw egg. Olive oil is progressively added to the mixture and the remaining ingredients (lime juice, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and Dijon mustard) are added in. The resulting hue of the dressing should be yellow, not the fake white version you commonly find in supermarkets.</p>

        <h2>China Facts</h2>
        <p>The Chinese New Year celebration lasts for 15 days.  In Ancient China, soldiers sometimes wore armour made from paper. More people speak Mandarin, a Chinese Dialect, as their first language than any other language in the world. The word “ketchup” may come from a Chinese word for pickled-fish sauce. Half of all pigs on earth live in China. China has thousands of rivers. The two main rivers are the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, which both flow from west to east. At 6,300 kilometres long, the Yangtze is the longest river in Asia and the third longest in the world.</p>
